# JSON-Object Dashboard App

Test App example will use a Node JS framework.

## Installation

Make sure the node version is up to date to install the JSON-Object Dashboard App.
Navigate to the root folder and run the install command.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

After the packages have been installed run:

```bash
npm run start
```

This is an app that pulls data from a local file containing the JSON object, we need to have the local server running in an additional tab. Open another tab and run:

```bash
npm run serve
```

If the console displays this message "Example app listening at http://localhost:4000" the local server should be running.
